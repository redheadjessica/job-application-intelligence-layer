# JAIL Changelog

Project changelog. Reverse chronological. Maintained as readable project memory: what
changed, what was explored, and why it mattered — not a commit log. Git history already
holds the granular record; this file is the curated account.

Add rough entries here during normal work (see `scripts/README.md` for the format).
Run `python3 scripts/doc_synthesis.py` to consolidate them into readable threads.

## Pre-2026-07-13 — Everything before the changelog existed

- JAIL shipped its V2 pipeline (Prep → Vet → Tailor → Reconcile/Archive) and the
  three-root layout (`ENGINE__PUBLIC_GIT_TRACKED` / `PRIVATE__YOUR_FILES_GITIGNORED` /
  `__READY_TO_REVIEW__PRIVATE_GITIGNORED`) before this changelog began. See
  `docs/v2-end-to-end-workflow.md` and `docs/testing-and-caveats.md` for that history.

## Earlier — Origins

- The project began as a single-purpose resume tailoring helper and grew into the full
  chained pipeline described in `README.md`.
